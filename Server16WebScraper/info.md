NodeJS Crawling
============

<p>Initially I wanted to scrape a school site for class schedules
using the node modules cheerio and request. It turns out that the site I wanted to scrape
uses an iframe for the data... and request doesn't like those. So I
decided to switch to selenium and grunt-mocha-webdriver.
